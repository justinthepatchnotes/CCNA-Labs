**Goal:** Connect the New York Branch to the Tokyo Branch.

---

In this lab the New York Branch has `PC1` and `PC2` connected to `SWITCH1`.

`SWITCH1` connects to `ROUTER1`, which then connects to `FIREWALL1`.

From there, packets move across the network to `ROUTER2` at the Tokyo Branch.

`ROUTER2` connects to `FIREWALL2`, which then connects to `SWITCH2`.

`SWITCH2` connects to `SERVER1` and `SERVER2`.

We also have an `ATTACKER` laptop connected to the **INTERNET** between the network backbone and `FIREWALL2`. This represents outside threats trying to access the network.
